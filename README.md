# Personal Utilities

This repository contains a collection of personal utilities and scripts that I use on my Linux system (CachyOS).

## Utilities

### [CachySwapKey](./cachyswapkey)

A utility script to automate the process of switching between two specific keyboards (Rexus Daxa M71 and Zuoya GMK67). It handles:
- Updating `/etc/modprobe.d/hid_apple.conf`.
- Updating initramfs.
- Reloading the `hid_apple` module.

See the [CachySwapKey README](./cachyswapkey/README.md) for detailed installation and usage instructions.

## Usage

Navigate to the specific directory of the utility you want to use and follow the instructions in its README.
